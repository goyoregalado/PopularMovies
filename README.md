== Popular Movies ==

This is my solution for the PopularMovies project proposed as part of the Android Associated Developer Fast Track from Udacity.

To add the API_KEY you should create a class called CredentialUtils into the package com.example.android.popularmovies.utilities

The class should look like this one.

public class CredentialUtils {
    public static final String APIKEY="YOUR API KEY HERE";
}
